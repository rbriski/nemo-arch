## Why create anÂ AMI?
AWS machine images are called AMIs. You can use existing AMIs for general use cases. For example, a clean install of Ubuntu Linux. You can also create custom AMIs for private use or publish it for public use.
NVIDIA actually already has a NeMo AMI image available. I tried using it but I was getting dependency conflicts on certain libraries that I was trying to install. I also just like to understand how the underlying system is built when I'm working on something so I decided to build my own AMI.
